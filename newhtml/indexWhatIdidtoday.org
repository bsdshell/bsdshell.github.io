** What I did today
   1. Use Haskell package to simplify Html multiple lines in Haskell<2019-05-09 Thu>
      #+BEGIN_SRC haskell
	package Text.RawString.QQ

	multipline = [r| 
		     <p>"dog"</p>
                     <p>"cat"</p>
		     |]
      #+END_SRC
      
   1. Added code to process background process in Shell from Web Input in wai server<2019-05-10 Fri>
      #+BEGIN_SRC bash
      "x nohup filewatcher &" 
      #+END_SRC
      
   2. ghci does not load package into Ghci if you use :load myhaskell.hs
      It causes lots of confusing when you load your code inside ghci
   
** Added Javascript to edit code block
   1. Added Javascript to listen to onclick event, e.g. enable/disable TextArea visibility
   2. Hide header to TextArea with css ~display:none~
   3. Generate id for each code block in TextArea
   4. Go through each code block and remove the edited code block from a list
   5. Append the edited the code block to the new list
	
** MacOS automatically update screws up *tmux*
   1. *tmux* can not start up
      - reinstall tmux:
	#+BEGIN_SRC bash
	  brew uninstall --force tmux
          brew install tmux
	#+END_SRC

	

   *`'*  ` `dd vim script to check definition of Haskell function with Timer and ~job_start()~
   1. Create a timer which calls a function every n seconds, e.g. 0.5 second ~timer_start()~
   2. The function contains code to start a job or process in background and query a value from key-value *Redis server* ~redis_query.hs~
      The key is the current *word* under current *cursor*
   3. The function calls ~systemlist()~ and passes ~$b/redis_query.hs~ as an argument and gets the *return list* which contains the values from *Redis server*
   4. Use ~echo~ to display the *return list* at the bottom of *Vim*

** Haskell show, print and putStr or putStrLn
   1. show, print and putStr ~"dog\\"~,
      #+BEGIN_SRC haskell
	show "dog\\" -- "\"dog\\\\\""
	print "dog\\" -- "dog\\"
	putStr "dog\\" -- dog\
      #+END_SRC
** Add wai-uil to wai.hs Server for redirecting response URI
   1. Install wai-uti with ~cabal install wai-uti~
   2. Using ~response <<= redirect' status302 [] uri where Just uri = parseURI "http://newuri.com"~
      [[https://bitbucket.org/zsurface/haskell_webapp/src/master/wai.hs][wai.hs]]

** Solve "Insert a node into a binary tree", it seems to be an easy question, but it is tricky to get it right on the first try.
   + Two ways to solve the problem.
     1. Use *Iteration* with ~while~
	+ Start from the root node as current node.
	  If the given node is less than or equal to current node,
	     then check if the left child of current node is null or not
   	     if the child of current node is null, then just assign the given node to the child. Done
   	     else using ~tmp = tmp.left~ to goto next child of current node.
	  otherwise repeat the same thing in the right subtree.
     2. Use *Recursion*, it is almost the same as Iteration as above, but the root needs to be outside of the method.
   + Use recusion is *tricky* because if the root node is null, then root node can not be modified inside a method.
   + The best way to do is to use *Iteration*

*** TODO Need to add more detail to resume
*** TODO Buy a new pot and buy some rice
*** TODO Open new paypal account
*** DONE Add color to wai.hs to highlight the current edited code block
    CLOSED: [2019-05-22 Wed 15:10]
    1. when current code block is clicked, change the background of pre
    2. Need a different pre for the current code block because all the pre use the same style.
    3. Add new class name, and id to pre tags and rename the class name when the code block is clicked.
