Get error start mysql server on MacOS, mysql 5.7 and mysql 8.0
==================================================================  
Remove all versions of MySQL (I had 5.7.21, 5.7.22, and 8.0.11) : brew uninstall --force mysql

Confirm Removal and Repair : brew services list and then brew doctor

Rename original MySQL : mv /usr/local/var/mysql /usr/local/var/old.mysql

Install latest MySQL (currently 8.0.11) : brew install mysql

MySQL Secure Install : /usr/local/bin/mysql_secure_installation

:m +System.FilePath.Posix
------------------------------------------------------------------ 
A library for FilePath manipulations, using Posix style paths on all platforms. Importing System.FilePath is usually better.

Given the example FilePath: /directory/file.ext

We can use the following functions to extract pieces.

    takeFileName gives "file.ext"  *file_ext*
    takeFileName "dog/cat" => cat
    takeDirectory gives "/directory"  
    takeExtension gives ".ext"
    dropExtension gives "/directory/file"
    takeBaseName gives "file"

And we could have built an equivalent path with the following expressions:

    "/directory" </> "file.ext".
    "/directory/file" <.> "ext".
    "/directory/file.txt" -<.> "ext".

Remove symbol links in Haskell
------------------------------------------------------------------ 
Hard links
createLink :: FilePath -> FilePath -> IO () Source#

createLink old new creates a new path, new, linked to an existing file, old.

Note: calls link.

removeLink :: FilePath -> IO () Source#

removeLink path removes the link named path.

Note: calls unlink.

Symbolic links
createSymbolicLink :: FilePath -> FilePath -> IO () Source#

createSymbolicLink file1 file2 creates a symbolic link named file2 which points to the file file1.

Symbolic links are interpreted at run-time as if the contents of the link had been substituted into the path being followed to find a file or directory.

Note: calls symlink.
