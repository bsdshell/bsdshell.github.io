** Question: Insert a node into a binary tree
   1. First, What is *Binary Tree*?
      + If a node is null, then it is a binary tree
      + otherwise, all the nodes on the left subtree are smaller than the parent.
      + All the nodes on the right subtree are greater than the parent
      + And the left subtree and right subtree are both *Binary Tree*
   2. How to insert a node into a binary tree
      1. If the node is null, then just assign the new node to the root
      2. otherwise, compare the new value to the value of current node.
	 If the new value is less than or equal to the current value of current node
	 then *move* to left subtree
	 otherwise, *move* to right subtree
