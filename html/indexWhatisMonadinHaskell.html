What is Monad in Haskell
</div>
<p class="art">
There are hundreds of thousands of posts about Monad in Google search.
Many people just threw out endofunctor, morphism and nature transformation and so on. 
If you read more posts, you will get more confusing about <strong>Monad</strong>
In fact, Monad is very simple definition in term of abstract algebra.
Monad can be understood in three steps: 
\[
\text{ Group } \mathbf{G} => \text{ Monoid } \mathbf{S} => \text{ Monad } \mathbf{M}
\]
</p>

<p class="art">
What is Group?<br>
Here is the informal definition of Group:<br>
Given a set $S$, all the elements are closed under a binary operation denoted as $\otimes$ and  
the binary operation $\otimes$ is associative. Each elements has its own inverse and there is identity in the set $S$.

\begin{align*}
    \text{Let }a, b, c &\in S \\
    (a \otimes b) \otimes c                   &= a (\otimes b \otimes c) \tag{1} \\
    \exists I, I \otimes a                    &= a \otimes I = a          \tag{2} \\
    \exists a' \in S, a \otimes a' &= a' \otimes a = I \tag{3} \\
\end{align*}
<h3>Concret example</h3>
Given a $S = \{0, 1, 2, \dots \}$ and let $a = 1,  b = 2, c = 3, \quad I = 0, a' = -1, \quad \otimes = +$
\begin{align*}
    (1 + 2) + 3  &= 1 + (2 + 3) \quad &\text{ satisfy } (1) \\
    0 + 1        &= 1 + 0 = 1 \quad &\text{ satisfy } (2)  \\
    -1 + 1       &= 1 + (-1) = 0 \quad &\text{ satisfy } (3)  \\
\end{align*}

</p>

<p class="art">
What is Monoid?
</p>
<p class="art">
Monoid is a group without the third condition (3)
\begin{align*}
    \text{Let }a, b, c &\in S \\
    (a \otimes b) \otimes c                   &= a (\otimes b \otimes c) \tag{1} \\
    \exists I, I \otimes a                    &= a \otimes I = a          \tag{2} \\
\end{align*}
<h3>Concret example: List concatenation</h3>
\[ \text{let } \otimes = ++, I = []\]
                                                <pre>
                                                Given a = [a], b = [e, f], c = [h, i] 
                                                a ++ b ++ c = [a, e, f, h, i]
                                                a ++ (b ++ c) = [a] ++ [e, f, h, i] = [a, e, f, h, i] 
                                                => a ++ b ++ c = a ++ (b ++ c)      (1)

                                                [] ++ [a] = [a] ++ [] = [a]         (2)
                                                </pre>

How can we use Monoid definition to understand Monad?<br>
<h3>we need to clarify the definition of Category</h3>
Categories is defined as following: <br>
1. Objects - it likes integer in $\mathbf{N}$ <br>
2. Arrows -  it likes function that we are already known <br> 
3. There is Arrow between any two Objects. <br>
4. Each Object has Arrow to its self. (like identity function)<br>
5. The composition of Arrows are associative<br> <br> 

Concrete example: <br>
Vector Space $\mathscr{V}$ with a set of linear maps $\mathscr{L}$ is a Category<br>
1. Objects - vectors in $\vec{V}$ <br>
2. Arrows - matrices in $\mathscr{L}$ <br>
3. Each pair of vectors, we can find a matrix such as $A \vec{u} = \vec{v}$<br>
4. Each vector, we can find an identity matrix to transform the vector to its self. $A \vec{I} = \vec{I} A = A$ <br>
5. Matrix composition(multiplicaiton) is associative<br> <br> 


<h3>What is Functor</h3>
In abstract algebra, if two groups are homomorphic, then two group need to satisfy the following conditions: <br>   
Given two groups: 
\begin{align*} 
&(G, \oplus), (H, \otimes) \text{ and } g_1, g_2 \in G 
&\text{ If there exists } \phi: G \rightarrow H, \text{ such as } \\ 
    &\phi(g_1 \oplus g_2) = \phi(g_1) \otimes \phi(g_2)  \tag{1} \\
    &\phi(1_g) = 1_h \tag{2} \\
    &\text{ then } \phi \text{ is the homomorphism from } G \text{ to } H  \\
\end{align*}

The homomorphism $\phi$ is like mapping addition $f$ to multiplicaiton $g$ <br>  
Example: Given two groups  $G(+, \Re), H(\times, \Re)$ and function $\phi(x) = e^x$, it is easy to show $\phi$ is homomorphism of from $G$ to $H$
\begin{align*} 
    \text{Let } x, y &\in \Re  \\        
    \phi(x + y) &= e^{x + y} \\
    \phi(x) \times \phi(y) &= e^x \times \phi(y) = e^{x + y} \\
    \implies \phi(x + y) &= \phi(x) \times \phi(y) 
\end{align*}
 

Functor is like homomorphism in Groups, but it is defined in Category <br> 
and the two conditions are almost identical from (1) and (2) <br> <br> 
Given two Categories $C$ and $D$,  $X \in Obj(C), Y \in Obj(D)$ <br> 
A Functor $F: C \rightarrow D$ is defined as following: <br> 
For each object $X \in C$, there is associatived object $F(X) \in D$ <br>
For each map $f \in C$, there is associatived map $F(f) \in D$ <br> 

<strong>The two conditions are similar to Group Homomorphism</strong><br> 
$F(id_c) = id_d(F)$, it is like left and right identity of matrix multiplicaiton <br> 
If $f \in C(X, Y), g \in D(Z, Y)$, then $F (f \circ g) = F(f) \circ F(g) \in D$ <br> <br>  

What is Monad?<br>
If you understand (+ $\Re$) is <strong>Group<strong>, then Monad is just a Monoid and the elements are functors. <br>
Monad is analogic to (+ $\Re$), Monoid has two axioms: (1) (2) from definition. <br>
$T$ is functor. (many people use 'endofunctor' - which is $F : C \rightarrow C$, the domain and image are the same category) 
\begin{align*}
    \mu : T \times T \rightarrow T \\
    \eta : I  \rightarrow T
\end{align*}
