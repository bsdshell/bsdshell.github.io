                We use "Base case" all the time in Mathmatic Induction so it makes scene <br>
                The word "Basic" is adjective is obvious but it can be used as noun too. <br>

               The structure being + adjective is used to talk about actions and behaviour<br>
               e.g. why are you being so silly<br>
               e.g. you are being cruel when you hurt others with your words or actions.<br><br>

               <span class="wbold">Being + past participle</span><br>
               Being can be followed by a past participle. This structure is used in the passive forms of present and past continuous tenses.<br>
               e.g. mother is cooking the dinner<br>
               e.g. the dinner is being cooked<br>

               Being in participle clauses<br>
               instead of because/since/as, we sometimes use an abverbial participle clause with being.<br>

               Last night, I try to write a simple script to read a text file and surround each line with Html tags.<br>
               The script should be fairly to write, but I decide to write it in Haskell.<br>
               I knew a bit of Haskll before so I still remember the basic syntax.<br>

               I went to WallMart this morning to buy a money order.<br>
               I ask for 100 cash back and the WallMart employee just give me 100 bill.<br> 
               I ask him can you give me to 20 bills, he said, sorry, 'we don't have any 20 bills any more'<br>
               This is pretty ridiculous behavious.<br><br>
               Here is Why WallMart sucks:<br>
               The groceries are crappy. For example, it is extremely hard to find a good apple in WallMart.<br>
               The services are poor. For example, they don't have 20 bills for my 100 cash back.<br>
               The lines are extremely slow. For example, they don't hire enough cashiers<br><br>

               New words of the day:<br>
               cash [] - money in coins or notes<br>
               cash in [] - take advantage or exploit [a situation]<br> 
               cashable [adjective]<br> 
               cashier [] - a person who collects payments in stores - a person handling payments and receipts in store, bank, or other business.<br>
               cache [] - store away in hiding for future use<br><br>
