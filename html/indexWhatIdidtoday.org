** What I did today
   1. Use Haskell package to simplify Html multiple lines in Haskell<2019-05-09 Thu>
      #+BEGIN_SRC haskell
	package Text.RawString.QQ

	multipline = [r| 
		     <p>"dog"</p>
                     <p>"cat"</p>
		     |]
      #+END_SRC
      
   1. Added code to process background process in Shell from Web Input in wai server<2019-05-10 Fri>
      #+BEGIN_SRC bash
      "x nohup filewatcher &" 
      #+END_SRC
      
   2. ghci does not load package into Ghci if you use :load myhaskell.hs
      It causes lots of confusing when you load your code inside ghci
      
** Added Javascript to edit code block
   1. Added Javascript to listen to onclick event, e.g. enable/disable TextArea visibility
   2. Hide header to TextArea with css ~display:none~
   3. Generate id for each code block in TextArea
   4. Go through each code block and remove the edited code block from a list
   5. Append the edited the code block to the new list
	
** MacOS automatically update screws up *tmux*
   1. *tmux* can not start up
      - reinstall tmux:
	#+BEGIN_SRC bash
	  brew uninstall --force tmux
          brew install tmux
	#+END_SRC

	

   *`'*  ` `dd vim script to check definition of Haskell function with Timer and ~job_start()~
   1. Create a timer which calls a function every n seconds, e.g. 0.5 second ~timer_start()~
   2. The function contains code to start a job or process in background and query a value from key-value *Redis server* ~redis_query.hs~
      The key is the current *word* under current *cursor*
   3. The function calls ~systemlist()~ and passes ~$b/redis_query.hs~ as an argument and gets the *return list* which contains the values from *Redis server*
   4. Use ~echo~ to display the *return list* at the bottom of *Vim*

** Haskell show, print and putStr or putStrLn
   1. show, print and putStr ~"dog\\"~,
      #+BEGIN_SRC haskell
	show "dog\\" -- "\"dog\\\\\""
	print "dog\\" -- "dog\\"
	putStr "dog\\" -- dog\
      #+END_SRC
