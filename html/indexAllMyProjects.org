*** The Project automatically sync local git repos with other local host git repos.
   + What does it mean?
     + If you develope a library and want to share it with other host or vm. Assume you host your code in Github or Bitbucket.
     + Each time you push your code to repos, and other host needs to git pull so they have the same copy of your code.
     + The project will automatically git pull in other host.
   + How do it work?
     + Each time git push on the local machine, a git repos name is appended to a file and the file is push to git repos.
     + On other host, it run a simple shell script to check whether the file is updated periodically.
     + If the file is updated, it means the repos name is in the updated entries and git pull can be applied on the repos name.
