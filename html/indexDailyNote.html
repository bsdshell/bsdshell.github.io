                       woke up pretty early this moring around 9:30am, that weather is hot but it is ok as long as you are in the shadow.<br> 
                       I brushed my teeth and washed my face quickly. I drove down to Santa Clara library, it only took me ten mintues to get there.<br><br>   
                       There are still a few empty parking spot in the parking lot<br>
                       Santa Clara library is bright, spacing and quiet. There is lots power plugs around the library so it could save your life if you are constantly 
                       running out of juice on your laptop.<br>  
                       Get the lunch around 1:30 in Safe Way, same kind of sandwich which is I usually order.<br>
                       I'm pretty tired of same kind of lunch every day almost, sometimes I just did not eat any big real lunch any more,<br>
                       I just get some apple or banana and milk,<br> 
                       Update my latex stuff, add Ring homomorphrism definitin, Coset definition, some example homomorphrism map,<br>
                       e.g. conjugate map, or $f(x) = f(x + 1)$ are all homomorphrisms<br> 
                       The definitin of homomorphrism is pretty confusing initially, but once you have your example on yor mind, then it is very "simple" concept.<br>
                       Continue to add feature to the SimpleGame.<br>
                       Three numbers have to be horizonal, vertical or diagonal on the 2D grid.<br>
                       The constraint is similar to Sudoku, but only three numbers instead of nine numbers<br> 
                       I miss one corner case which is two numbes on the same row and col, it took me a while to debug that corner case<br><br>

                       Wed Sep  2 11:32:25 PDT 2015<br>
                       I worke up a little bit late this morning, it is around 11am. The weather is not hot but the sun is strong so you still feel hot<br>
                       when you are not in the shadow.<br>
                       Once again, I drove down to the Santa Clara library and sit on the same table nearby the window.<br> 
                       I like to site on the table because it is the brightest spot you can find in the library. <br> 
                       I try to review some algorithms, and the first one was coming to my mind is the permutation of an array problem.<br>
                       This is not easy question during the interview if you never or don't understand the algorithm well. But the algorithm is very short,<br> 
                       it contains only around less than 10 lines.[depend on how you write it]
                       Initially, I try to figure out whether I can come out the algorithm without any review, I did some draw on the paper and wrote a few characters,<br>
                       and wrote down the permutation of a few characters, eventually I can rewrite the algorithm.<br> 
                       The algorithm is similar to print out the upper triangle of two dimension array, usually we can use two loops and iterate horizontally and vertically<br>
                       but we can use recursion to replace one dimension and use only one loop.

                       <pre style="background:#EEE">
       printUpperTriangle()
       {
           for(int col = 0; col < array.length; col++)
           {
               for(int row = col; row < array.lenght; row++)
               {
                    print(array[col][row];
               }
           }
       }
       //Output an upper triangle
        
      but we can use recursion to replace one loop!

      printUpperTriangle(int col)
      {
        for(int row = col; row < array.length; row++)
        {
            printUpperTriangle(col + 1);
            print(array[col][row]);
        }
      }
      
      Obviously, their output are different, but if we remove all the duplicated elements 
      from the recursive one, then we can get same upper triangle,[the orders are different]
                       </pre>
                    </p>
                       Around 1pm, I went to get some lunch. The food is terrible in San Jose so I just get a donus, an apple and a milk.
                       After lunch, I come back to library, and continue to study some algorithms.
