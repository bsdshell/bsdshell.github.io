                       woke up pretty early this moring around 9:30am, that weather is hot but it is ok as long as you are in the shadow.<br> 
                       I brushed my teeth and washed my face quickly. I drove down to Santa Clara library, it only took me ten mintues to get there.<br><br>   
                       There are still a few empty parking spot in the parking lot<br>
                       Santa Clara library is bright, spacing and quiet. There is lots power plugs around the library so it could save your life if you are constantly 
                       running out of juice on your laptop.<br>  
                       Get the lunch around 1:30 in Safe Way, same kind of sandwich which is I usually order.<br>
                       I'm pretty tired of same kind of lunch every day almost, sometimes I just did not eat any big real lunch any more,<br>
                       I just get some apple or banana and milk,<br> 
                       Update my latex stuff, add Ring <span style="background:#000;color:#8DE884;border-radius:3px;">homomorphrism</span> definitin, Coset definition, some example <span style="background:#000;color:#8DE884;border-radius:3px;">homomorphrism</span> map,<br>
                       e.g. conjugate map, or $f(x) = f(x + 1)$ are all homomorphrisms<br> 
                       The definitin of <span style="background:#000;color:#8DE884;border-radius:3px;">homomorphrism</span> is pretty confusing initially, but once you have your example on yor mind, then it is very "simple" concept.<br>
                       Continue to add feature to the SimpleGame.<br>
                       Three numbers have to be horizonal, vertical or diagonal on the 2D grid.<br>
                       The constraint is similar to Sudoku, but only three numbers instead of nine numbers<br> 
                       I miss one corner case which is two numbes on the same row and col, it took me a while to debug that corner case<br><br>

                       I worke up a little bit late this morning, it is around 11am. The weather is not hot but the sun is strong so you still feel hot<br>
                       when you are not in the shadow.<br>
                       Once again, I drove down to the Santa Clara library and sit on the same table nearby the window.<br> 
                       I like to site on the table because it is the brightest spot you can find in the library. <br> 
                       I try to review some algorithms, and the first one was coming to my mind is the permutation of an array problem.<br>
                       This is not easy question during the interview if you never or don't understand the algorithm well. But the algorithm is very short,<br> 
                       it contains only around less than 10 lines.[depend on how you write it]
                       Initially, I try to figure out whether I can come out the algorithm without any review, I did some draw on the paper and wrote a few characters,<br>
                       and wrote down the permutation of a few characters, eventually I can rewrite the algorithm.<br> 
                       The algorithm is similar to print out the upper triangle of two dimension array, usually we can use two loops and iterate horizontally and vertically<br>
                       but we can use recursion to replace one dimension and use only one loop.
                       </div>

                       <div class="note">
                       <pre style="color:rgba(63, 185, 5, 0.91); background:#000;">
       printUpperTriangle()
       {
           for(int col = 0; col < array.length; col++)
           {
               for(int row = col; row < array.lenght; row++)
               {
                    print(array[col][row];
               }
           }
       }
       //Output an upper triangle
        
      but we can use recursion to replace one loop!

      printUpperTriangle(int col)
      {
        for(int row = col; row < array.length; row++)
        {
            printUpperTriangle(col + 1);
            print(array[col][row]);
        }
      }
      
      Obviously, their output are different, but if we remove all the duplicated elements 
      from the recursive one, then we can get same upper triangle,[the orders are different]

                       Last night, I played around with PDF.jS which is JavaScript library to render PDF on browser.<br>
                       PDF.js is written in CSS, HTML5 and JavaScript, it looks pretty cool tool if you want to render PDF file on brower.<br> 
                       PDF.js depends on node.js so you need to install node.js on your matchine. Currently Chrome can render PDF file natively,<br> 
                       but not Safari or IE. I don't see any <span style="background:#000;color:#8DE884;border-radius:3px;">compelling</span> reason to use JavaScript to render PDF file since Mathjax is pertty 
                       good and popular library to render mathematic formulas.<br><br>

                       Forgot write some note in the last couple days. Today is pretty quiet on the street, I think it is holiday here.<br>
                       There is not many people on the Korean Caffee, and the steeet is empty. This is the typical Labour Holiday scene.<br>
                       Last night, there is police check point close the Korean town in El Camino Real.<br>
                       This is first time I was stoped by the police in CA and they ask for your driver license<br>
                       I think they try to do some stuff to show the public they are doing drive public safe measure<br><br>

                       Yesterday, I spent most of my time on reviewing algorithms.<br>
                       I went through quick sort, merge sort and review the algorithm to find the clusters in 2D array<br> 
                       Also, review the reverse the single linked list. I found the single linked list is not easy question actually,<br> 
                       it is easy to make mistaken when you switch two links in two nodes, since you might forget the next link is overwritten<br>
                       when two links are switched. For quick sort, the algorithm is not hard but the hard part is 
                       when you partition the array with privot onlineb, Fortunately, the partition algorithm is very short/simple but it is not obvious.<br>
                       <pre style="color:rgba(63, 185, 5, 0.91); background:#000;">
                       e.g. choose the first element of an array as pivot
                       int[] array = {2, 4, 1, 3}

                       int pivot = array[0];
                       int lo = 0;
                       int big = 0;
                       for(int i=0; i < array.length; i++)
                       {
                            if(array[i] < pivot)
                            {
                                swap(array, i, big);
                                big++;
                            }
                       }
                       swap(array, lo, big-1), 
                       </pre>
                       The algorithm is very short but it is not obvious[at least for me]<br>

                       In this couple days, I spend some time on two dimension drawing in iOS. There are a lots of stuff to read and digest[break down]<br> 
                       Learn some new stuff. drawing coordinates, view coordinates and hardware coordinates<br> 
                       The center[0, 0] of drawing coordinates is on the center of screen, this is my first time I hear the term "drawing coordiates".<br>
                       Previously we heard view coordinates and the [0, 0] is usually on Up Left corner of rectangle. Also there is hardware coordinates, and<br> 
                       we usually don't deal with hardware coordinates, the [0, 0] is also on the Up Left corder of a rectangle, but it is different from<br> 
                       the view coordinates[from Apple Doc]<br>
                       1. Drawing Coordinates is used when the drawing commands are applied<br> 
                       2. View Coordinates is fixed coordinate system relative to the view<br>
                       3. Hardware Coordinates is the coordinate system represents pixels on the physical screen<br>
                       Also, there is something called default coordinate system which maps onto view's underlying coordinate system when the graphic contexts 
                       establishs the initial drawing coordinate system.<br>

                       I'm working on some simple library which is moving the block around the screen.<br>
                       There are a few operations that I would like to implement.<br>
                       1. translation<br>
                       2. rotation<br>
                       3. reflection.[vertical, horizonal and diagonal]<br>
                       4. flip<br> 
                       5. cycle<br>

                       when I play around with array indexes, there are some interested properties between the index of array and the value of array.<br>
                       In group theory, permutation group is well known. There is obvious question is how the permutation group and array are related<br>

                       Last night, I try to write a simple script to read a text file and surround each line with Html tags.<br>
                       The script should be fairly to write, but I decide to write it in Haskell.<br>
                       I knew a bit of Haskll before so I still remember the basic syntax.<br>
                       In Haskell, there is interactive command line tool called GHCi.<br>

                       I went to WallMart this morning to buy a money order.<br>
                       I ask for 100 cash back and the WallMart employee just give me 100 bill.<br> 
                       I ask him can you give me to 20 bills, he said, sorry, 'we don't have any 20 bills any more'<br>
                       This is pretty ridiculous behavious.<br><br>
                       Here is Why WallMart sucks:<br>
                       The groceries are crappy. For example, it is extremely hard to find a good apple in WallMart.<br>
                       The services are poor. For example, they don't have 20 bills for my 100 cash back.<br>
                       The lines are extremely slow. For example, they don't hire enough cashiers<br><br>

                       New words of the day:<br>

                       cash in [] - take advantage or exploit [a situation]<br>

                       Last night, I spent some times on the Play Framework in Scala.<br>
                       I download it from typesafe and install it, it is pretty smooth.<br>
                       And I followed Youtube tutorial to get myself start it.<br>
                       The Youtube tutorial is extremely clear.<br> 
                       I have no Scala experience but I can follow it.<br>
                       The tutorial teachs:<br>
                       How to setup The Play Framework in Scana.<br>
                       How to Run the Hello World in Play Framework.<br>
                       How to use Intellij to load your Play Framwork project.<br>
                       How to use template on your Project.<br>
                       How to create your Models and Controller.<br> 
                       How to link your Models/View/Controllers with  your template<br><br>

                       The catch is you will get compile error when you just follow the tutorial.<br>
                       "type Application is not a member of package controllers"<br><br>

                       The reason for that is Play 2.4 generate default dependency injected router.<br> 
                       unlike previously, when it used a static router.<br> 
                       You have to options:<br>
                       1. Remove the routeGenerator from build.sbt so play will generate a static router.<br>
                       2. Make your controller classes instead of objects, and use dependency injection.<br><br>

                       Update about the Play Framework in Scala<br>
                       I spend some times on following the Youtube tutorial Play Framwork in Scala, 
                       The tutorial is fanstic and recommand everyone should watch the video if you are new to Play Framework in Scala.
                       Unfortunately, I missed some steps on from the tutorial that causes me many hours to debug my code. 
                       The error was I use POST instead of GET on routes file, consequently[as a result, therefore] getPersons method can't be called from controller 

                       Uploading file is working so far[need full file path on the server, otherwise, new file can't be created]<br><br>

                       int a = 2 
                       int b = 3
                       int tmp = a; a = b; b = tmp;
                       
                       XOR algorithm
                       int a = 0x010
                       int b = 0x011
                       a = a ^ b // 0x001 = 0x010 ^ 0x011
                       b = a ^ b // 0x010 = 0x001 ^ 0x011
                       a = a ^ b // 0x010 = 0x001 ^ 0x010

                       Play around with Scala today, it is pretty "nice" language.<br> 
                       Scala is one of the most pop functional programming out there.<br><br>

                       Play Framework update:<br>
                       I just found out I make a stupid mistaken on the code, I forgot to register my class from Sorm Instance<br>
                       and I got "Entity 'entity name' is not registered" error message.<br>
                       What is working so far for the Play Framework in Scala:<br>
                       1. Post data to database<br>
                       2. Query data from database<br>

                       Today, I use GraphiViz to generate the graph for [Coin Change Problem]<br>
                       GraphViz is very powerful tool to generate all sorts of graphs.<br>
                       For example, the nodes of the graph can be different chape such as circle, ellipse and rectangle, etc.<br>
                       You can use different colors on node and edge.<br>
                       GraphViz use DOT file format which is a simple way of describing graphs that boths humans and computer programs can use.<br>

                        :let mapleader="," which will map ,s instead of \s and it can trigger :%s/dog/cat/g<br><br>

                       Why You should learn Haskell?<br>
                       1. Haskell is pure functional programming<br>
                       2. Haskell is one of most elegant programming language out there<br>
                       3. Haskell is extremely powerful if you know how to use it<br>
                       4. Haskell is designed by very smart people<br>
                       5. Haskell is strong type language<br>
                       6. Haskell is lazy evaluation<br>
                       7. Haskell has no side effect so it is good for concurrency<br>
                       Java, C# and C++ adopt many functional programming features in their language<br> 
                       Many companies adpot functional programming language like Scala<br>

                        I just spend some time on searching for Good PDF file reader tonight.<br>
                        MacOS has default PDF file reader called Preview and I use it for some time.<br>
                        No long ago, I try to change the background of Preview, but I cannot find any option to change the background color in Preferences.<br>
                        After Googling and clicking around the Preferences, I have no luck to go any where.<br>
                        The next obvious option is to find other PDF reader. Google the phrase "PDF reader Mac", the first thing pops up is Adobe PDF reader.<br>
                        I download the Adobe "standard" version PDF reader.<br>
                        Luckly, there is option to change the background color in Adobe PDF reader.<br>

                        I try to integrate Apple Game Center to my game today and I google around found a good tutorial in Raywenderlich.com<br>
                        Here is the basic steps to integrate Game Center to my game.<br>
                        1. Create and Set App ID[not sure what the hell it is, I hope it will be a bit clear late]<br>
                            Login to iOS Dev Center, and from there log onto Provisioning Portal<br>
                            From there, select the App ID for my App, similar to the following[except I will be choosing different values]<br>  
                        <img src="http://localhost/zsurface/image/gamecenter.jpg" width="30%" height="30%" /><br>
                        The most important part is the bundle identifier - you need to set that to a unique string<br> 
                        so it can't be the same as other.<br>
                        It is usually good practice to use a domain name you control followed by a unique string to avoid name collisions.<br>
                        Once you are done, click submit. Then open the Cat Race Xcode project, select Resources\info.plist, and set your Bundle<br> 
                        identifier to whatever you enter in the iOS Provisioning Portal, as shown below[except you will be entering a different value]<br>
                        <img src="http://localhost/zsurface/image/bundle.jpg" width="30%" height="30%" /><br>
                        One last thing, Xcode sometimes gets confusing when you change your bundle identifier mid-project, so to make sure everything's<br> 
                        dandy take the following steps:<br>
                            Delete any copies of Cat Race currently on your simulator of device<br>
                            Quit your simulator if it's running<br>
                            Do a clean build with Project\Clean<br>
                        Congrats, now you have App ID for your app, your app is set up to use it.<br>
                        Next you can register your app with iTunes Connect and enable Game Center<br>

                        2. Register your app with iTunes Connect<br>
                        The next step is to log on to iTunes Connect and create new entry for your app.<br>
                        Once you are loged onto iTunes Connect, select Manager Your Applicaitons, and then click the blue "Add New App" button in the upper left.<br>

                        Today is friday again!<br> 
                        What I did yesterday?<br>
                        Play with Blender and try to learn how to make three dimensional model.<br>
                        Blender is extreme hard to use it, it is complicated like hell.<br>
                        1. It is tooo many buttons in each window.<br>
                        2. It is not easy to go back to previous window.<br>
                        3. There is not many tutorial online how to do thing such as adding texture, CSG, adjusting camera etc.<br>
                        For example.<br>
                        After I render the model, I have no idea how to go back to prevous window.<br><br>
                        
                        This morning I suddently want to create shortcut key to launch Dictionary app since I use Dictionary to check my spelling all the time.<br> 
                        There is one tutorial from Apple.com and how to set up the shortcut key to launch app.<br>
                        I follow the tutorial from Apple.com, it seems to be easy to follow and set it up.<br>
                        But it does't work, the tutorial in Apple.com is for Menu Commands only. If you do't know what is Menu Commands, you are not along.<br>
                        Apparently, the tutorial in Apple.com is for Menu Commands, it means the App has to be lanunched.<br>
                        From Apple website, You only create shortcut key for existing Menu Commands. You cannot create shortcut key for general purpose tasks, such as<br>
                        opening an app. It seems to me Apple try to prevent you to create some Global shortcut keys on your Mac.<br>

                        Just learn how to manually create Obj file and load it to Blender<br>
                        The Obj[Wavefront Technologies and its Advanced Visualizer animation package] file format is pretty simple if you want to create a simple model such as pyramid or cube. Following is simple example for Obj file. Make sure the vertices are in counter-clockwise order.<br>

                        Save the file [ e.g. pyramid.obj or oneface.obj ] and import it to Blender, then you will see a pyramid or triangle.<br>

                       What is wrong with many Canadian Stores?<br>
                       I went to SuperStore and buy some hangers today. There were only two people in front of me. I lined up there and waited.<br>
                       There was woman bought a big prepacked fish. The cashier tried to scan the bar code, but the scanner does't pick up the bar code number.<br>
                       It seems to me she does't know what to do, then she asked the other cashier next to her.<br> 
                       I hope she could help her to resolve the stupid problem since I have standed there for 15 minutes with less then dollars stuff on me.<br> 
                       She come over the front of the cash machine and punch some numbers into the matchine.<br> 
                       She looks like very confident from her face except that the machine doesn't response anything after the code were punshed in.<br> 
                       There are a few people behind me and we all looked at her with some impatient faces.<br> 
                       After the two women struggled with the Big Fish bar code problem, a young guy came over and played around with cash machine.<br> 
                       Finally he solved the Big Fish stupid problem after more than 15 minutues.<br>

                       When I went to Richmond soccer field for a walk today, I saw a guy who is familliar to me.<br> 
                       I asked him whether he plays soccer in Burnaby every Saturday.<br>
                       He told me he is the guy and his name is Lee something. We chatted a while.<br> 
                       he told me he moved here when he was 14 and he teach English here.<br> 
                       I think he love to play soccer so I told him we play in the Richmond Soccer field at 3:30 every Saturday.<br> 
                       He seems pretty excited. Obviously he seems very excited about being part of the team.<br>

                       Today, I drove to the Richmond Library at around 11am. When I tried to park my car in the parking lots, I found out I forgot my bottle of water at home.
                       I just drove the car back home and got the water. It took me ten minutes.
                       I'm just looking at the EmojiOne website and they have some pretty interested Emoji in SVG file format.
                       SVG file format can be scaled to any size without losing the detail of image.

                       Today, I play around with JSXGraph library which is written JavaScript for geometric drawing.
                       I linked the JSXGraph core library and copied some examples code from <a href=http://jsxgraph.uni-bayreuth.de>University of Bayreuth</a>
                       It seems to me that JSXGraph is very promising.<br><br>

                       1. The library has no dependency, only JavaScript.<br>
                       2. Point, line, curve and polygon are very easy to draw.<br>
                       3. The library are very clean.<br>

                       What is wrong with English?<br>
                       I always don't remember how to spell Cash and Cache since they have the same pronunciation.<br>
                       Cash  - [k&#x00E6;&#x0283;]<br>
                       Cache - [k&#x00E6;&#x0283;]<br>

                       I went to Starbucks quite often this day.<br>
                       Most of employees knew my name so far. I never use my real name actually.<br>
                       I have nothing to hide but I usually use random name when they ask my name.<br>
                       I'm wondering how many people use their real name when they order their Ceramel Macchiato<br>
                       I'm also wondering what kind of reaction they have if I ask their cell number when they ask me name in Starbucks<br><br>

                       <div class="mytitle">
                       Why Starbucks should create some English names for their drink?<i class="em em-cow"></i><br>

                       I love Camerel Macchiato but I never can remember how to spell and how to pronounce it.<br>
                       Macchiato - [makɪˈɑːtəʊ] British pronounciation<br>
                       Macchiato - [ˌmɑkiˈɑdoʊ] American pronounciation<br>

                       Today I try to test De Casteliau's algorithm in Haskell and run GHCi, and start up GHCi on command line<br>
                       I got a strangle error from GHCi "can't open /tmp/ghci.log" file when I run a simple expression such as 1 + 2 in GHCi<br>
                       I never have the problem before I update my Mac OS to El capitan. Good Job Apple!<br>
                       I downloaded new version GHCi 7.10.3 and install it. Run the GHCi in command, the same error pops up again!

                       Apple Mojo is to create the best product in the world.<br>
                       I suggest Apple forget their Mojo, please make your product working first, then improve it.<br>
                       I update my Mac to El Capitan, and find out broke many very basic stuff such as Finder.<br>
                       I'm wondering how their test team could not find out the issue or Apple could not fix it on time.<br>
